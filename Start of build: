Detection Modules: Design these to work with the AI models and monitor real-time data.
Response Mechanisms: Plan for automated responses that neutralize threats upon detection.
Database Schema Design:

Outline the schema for storing detected threats, system logs, and user actions.
Ensure the database is secure, scalable, and optimized for performance.
UI/UX Wireframes:

Sketch wireframes for the dashboard that will display monitoring data, threat alerts, and reports.
Plan the API documentation interface for developers who will interact with your system.
Phase 3: AI Model Development
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

Clean the dataset and extract relevant features that will help the AI models in detection.
Train Initial Models:

Start with supervised learning models using labeled data of known exploits.
Experiment with anomaly detection algorithms for unknown threats.
Validate Model Performance:

Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure models are accurate and reliable.
Optimize models based on performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Phase 4: Core System Development
Develop Monitoring Systems:

Build a real-time monitoring system that captures network traffic, system behavior, and logs.
Implement Detection Modules:

Integrate your AI models into detection modules that analyze the monitoring data for potential threats.
Create Automated Response Mechanisms:

Develop scripts or modules that trigger specific actions (e.g., blocking IPs, isolating systems) when a threat is detected.
Backend API Development:

Build APIs that allow interaction with external systems and the web-based dashboard.
Database Setup:

Implement the database schema and ensure itâ€™s connected to the detection modules and APIs.
Phase 5: Frontend Development
Build Web-Based Dashboard:

Develop a user interface for monitoring, configuring, and reporting threats.
Visualization Tools:

Integrate charts, graphs, and other visual elements to present data intuitively.
Configuration Panel:

Provide users with options to configure system settings, detection thresholds, and response protocols.
API Documentation:

Write clear and detailed documentation to guide users and developers in interacting with your system.
Phase 6: System Integration & Testing
Integrate Components:

Bring together all the modules, including AI models, monitoring systems, and response mechanisms.
Testing:

Conduct unit tests for individual components, integration tests for overall system interaction, and performance tests for handling large volumes of data.
Security Testing:

Ensure the system itself is secure and not vulnerable to exploitation.
Phase 7: Deployment & Scalability Planning
Deploy System:

Set up the system on your chosen infrastructure, whether cloud-based or on-premises.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines for easy updates and maintenance.
Scalability Planning:

Prepare for future growth by planning how to scale the system horizontally or vertically.
Phase 8: Documentation & Training
Document the System:

Create detailed documentation for system architecture, setup, configuration, and usage.
User Guides & Training:

Provide training materials, such as guides, tutorials, and webinars, to help users understand the system.
Phase 9: Post-Deployment Monitoring & Maintenance
Continuous Monitoring:

Set up ongoing monitoring for system performance, user activity, and detected threats.
System Updates & Security Audits:

Regularly update the system and retrain AI models as needed. Conduct periodic security audits.
User Feedback:

Collect feedback and iterate on the system to improve functionality and address emerging threats.
Starting the Project:
Initial Setup:

Clone the repository and install dependencies.
Set up environment variables and initialize the database.
Follow the Project Map:

Begin with Phase 1 tasks and proceed through the phases in order.
Use the progress tracking section to monitor milestones and adjust plans as needed.
