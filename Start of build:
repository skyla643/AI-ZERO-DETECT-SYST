   - Optimize models based on performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Phase 4: Core System Development**

1. **Develop Monitoring Systems:**
   - Build a real-time monitoring system that captures network traffic, system behavior, and logs.

2. **Implement Detection Modules:**
   - Integrate your AI models into detection modules that analyze the monitoring data for potential threats.

3. **Create Automated Response Mechanisms:**
   - Develop scripts or modules that trigger specific actions (e.g., blocking IPs, isolating systems) when a threat is detected.

4. **Backend API Development:**
   - Build APIs that allow interaction with external systems and the web-based dashboard.

5. **Database Setup:**
   - Implement the database schema and ensure itâ€™s connected to the detection modules and APIs.

### **Phase 5: Frontend Development**

1. **Build Web-Based Dashboard:**
   - Develop a user interface for monitoring, configuring, and reporting threats.

2. **Visualization Tools:**
   - Integrate charts, graphs, and other visual elements to present data intuitively.

3. **Configuration Panel:**
   - Provide users with options to configure system settings, detection thresholds, and response protocols.

4. **API Documentation:**
   - Write clear and detailed documentation to guide users and developers in interacting with your system.

### **Phase 6: System Integration & Testing**

1. **Integrate Components:**
   - Bring together all the modules, including AI models, monitoring systems, and response mechanisms.

2. **Testing:**
   - Conduct unit tests for individual components, integration tests for overall system interaction, and performance tests for handling large volumes of data.

3. **Security Testing:**
   - Ensure the system itself is secure and not vulnerable to exploitation.

### **Phase 7: Deployment & Scalability Planning**

1. **Deploy System:**
   - Set up the system on your chosen infrastructure, whether cloud-based or on-premises.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines for easy updates and maintenance.

3. **Scalability Planning:**
   - Prepare for future growth by planning how to scale the system horizontally or vertically.

### **Phase 8: Documentation & Training**

1. **Document the System:**
   - Create detailed documentation for system architecture, setup, configuration, and usage.

2. **User Guides & Training:**
   - Provide training materials, such as guides, tutorials, and webinars, to help users understand the system.

### **Phase 9: Post-Deployment Monitoring & Maintenance**

1. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Set up ongoing monitoring for system performance, user activity, and detected threats.

2. **System Updates & Security Audits:**
   - Regularly update the system and retrain AI models as needed. Conduct periodic security audits.

3. **User Feedback:**
   - Collect feedback and iterate on the system to improve functionality and address emerging threats.

### **Starting the Project:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Clone the repository and install dependencies.
   - Set up environment variables and initialize the database.

2. **Follow the Project Map:**
   - Begin with Phase 1 tasks and proceed through the phases in order.
   - Use the progress tracking section to monitor milestones and adjust plans as needed.
