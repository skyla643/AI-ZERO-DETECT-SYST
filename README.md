# AI-Driven Zero-Day Exploit Detection and Defense System

## Overview

This project is an AI-Driven Zero-Day Exploit Detection and Defense System designed to provide robust protection against zero-day vulnerabilities. By leveraging advanced AI models, real-time monitoring, and automated response mechanisms, this system aims to detect and neutralize threats before they can exploit unknown vulnerabilities in your infrastructure.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes machine learning models to detect previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-time.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors network traffic and system behavior to identify potential threats.
- **Automated Response**: Implements defense mechanisms to neutralize threats as they are detected.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzes system and user behavior to identify anomalies that indicate zero-day exploits.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrates with global threat intelligence feeds to stay ahead of emerging threats.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on detected vulnerabilities and actions taken to mitigate them.
